# DRC
Download Reddit Comments by GoDzM4TT3O

***

## How to use
1. Run the program;

2. You will be asked for a comment frequency (this is how comments will be sorted). 
Enter a comment frequency, for example I will type 'day';

3. Next, you will be asked how many comments you want to download. The minimum number of comments that will be accepted is 10;

4. Next, you will be asked a Reddit username. This is required because the program will download x comments made by them;

5. This step is optional. You will be asked a subreddit. The program will download specified number of said user's comments from specified subreddit.

6. The comments will be downloaded to a .DRC.txt file. Example: I chose to download my comments, so the output file will be called 'GoDzM4TT3O.DRC.txt'

## TODO

- [x] FIX Unicode errors (THANK GOD I spent too many hours on this)

- [x] Create a new file based on the username and write the reddit comments

- [x] Convert Unicode to ASCII

- [x] Fix whitespace error in name (if there were any spaces in the username it wouldn't work)

- [x] Fix 'b' before comment body (b'comment')

- [x] Make code more readable (thanks to cclauss)

- [ ] Use UTF-8 instead of ASCII
